# DiceRollerMobileApp
Just a simple Dice Roller game app that have been made by using Kotlin.

Thanks to Android Student Club and Google Developer Student Clubs, I attended a course/bootcamp that i can learn kotlin and how to develop mobile apps. This bootcamp will last for 4 months. So, i will share a lot of apps and updates on here.
